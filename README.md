An alternate way to queue for Overwatch 2 matches. Intended to provide a different experience than the built in ranked system, this website provides users an interface to queue for casual Overwatch games. Users are responsible for hosting the lobbies after a match is created.

Detailed statistics can be tracked and displayed on the user's profile.

Includes a trivia minigame while waiting in queue!

Created as a final project for Advanced Software Design class.
